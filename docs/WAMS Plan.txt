WAMS Plan

+ means done

Highest priority in priority order (preferably before Tuesday):
+ cloning and connecting
  + fixing reported problems
+ selection of connection
  - stronger highligt for selected connection
+ saving resulting model in JSON file
- scaling has too large gain
- make sure ports are shown (also when label not present) DONE?
- remove Reset camera since we have escape button for that
- allow cloning and connecting on mobile device
- allow panning on mobile device
- cloning by Cntrl+drag
- allow connection by directly clicking on port without first selection of component
- two layout modes: auto, manual
- draw a connection line immediately when a connection is made
- adjust connections lines when a component is moved (add one new line segment for all connection lines)
- give the cloned component unique name (among siblings), e.g. by adding sequence number: name_1, name_2

Middle priority in priority order (beginning of next week):
- Arrow left/right for rotation +/- 90 degrees (on touch screen?)- proper reset when loading new file (also reloading the same file)
- remove Selected Objects buttons
- Up/Down buttons for tilting +/- 10 degrees
- implement texts using canvas
- keep positions in Klay data structure to allow incremental layout option INTERACTIVE
- handle rotation
- zooming with wheel around mouse pointer location

Lower unsorted issues:
+ using viewBox information for a larger canvas
- making connections long enough also with automatic layout
+ introducing constants for width of connections, color of background, color of group rectangle, etc 
- missing bus connector icons: fullRobot

- allowing larger zooming interval DONE?
+ panning on left button
- reading info from combined file
- occasional problem with selecting
- allowing use on iOS
+ larger name text below icon (with parameters)
- automatic calculation of extent for the whole model and initial zooming
- size of 3D icons (Resistor, etc)
+ show error messages from KlayJS, e.g.: "An edge's source or target node could not be resolved."
