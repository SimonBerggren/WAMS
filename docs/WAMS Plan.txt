WAMS Plan

+ means done

Highest priority in priority order (preferably before Tuesday):
+ New, Open
+ Modes (radio buttons?)
  + Authoring/Visualization
  + Automatic layout/Manual layout
+ use combined JSON file
+ Animation: Stop -> Rewind, Speed
+ Simulate
  + Set time interval: start time (default=0) and stop time
  + Simulate
- Arrow left/right for rotation +/- 90 degrees
- Up/Down buttons for tilting +/- 10 degrees  

+ use special highlight of ports when one port is selected
+ allow panning on mobile device
  + make it possible to create a small model
  + enable loading of icons
+ remove the x- and y-axis arrows when in 2D Object Control Mode
+ two layout modes: auto, manual
  + make new layout when changing to aumatomatic mode
+ draw a connection line immediately when a connection is made	
+ double click to deselect
+ adjust connections lines when a component is moved (also in z-direction) (add one new line segment for all connection lines)

+ cloning and connecting
  + fixing reported problems
+ selection of connection
  + stronger highligt for selected connection
  ? Make it easier to select connection, i.e. not having to be so precise.
+ saving resulting model in JSON file
  + allow loading again
  + allow loading with icons
+ scaling has too large gain
  + scaling is not consistent with cursor movement
+ make sure ports are shown (also when label not present) DONE?
+ allow cloning and connecting on mobile device
+ cloning by Cntrl+drag
+ allow connection by directly clicking on port without first selection of component
+ give the cloned component unique name (among siblings), e.g. by adding sequence number: name_1, name_2

Middle priority in priority order (beginning of next week):
- when in 2D Object Control Mode, make the drag plane larger (all quadrants)
- put connection lines that are not in the same connection set on different z-level (in order that crossings is handled correct visually)
+ proper reset when loading new file (also reloading the same file)
- implement texts using canvas
- keep positions in Klay data structure to allow incremental layout option INTERACTIVE
- handle rotation
- zooming with wheel around mouse pointer location

Lower unsorted issues:
+ using viewBox information for a larger canvas
- making connections long enough also with automatic layout
+ introducing constants for width of connections, color of background, color of group rectangle, etc 
? missing bus connector icons: fullRobot

+ allowing larger zooming interval DONE?
+ panning on left button
- allowing use on iOS
+ larger name text below icon (with parameters)
- automatic calculation of extent for the whole model and initial zooming
- size of 3D icons (Resistor, etc)
+ show error messages from KlayJS, e.g.: "An edge's source or target node could not be resolved."
